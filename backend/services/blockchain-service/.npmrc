# AUDIT FIX #61: Pin dependencies to exact versions
#
# This file ensures all future npm installs use exact versions
# instead of ranges (^1.2.3 or ~1.2.3)
#
# Benefits:
# - Reproducible builds across environments
# - No surprise breaking changes from minor/patch updates
# - Security: known exact versions being audited

# Save packages with exact versions (no ^ or ~)
save-exact=true

# Also apply to dev dependencies
save-dev-exact=true

# Use package-lock.json for deterministic installs
package-lock=true

# Don't auto-update package.json on install
save=false

# Security settings
audit=true
audit-level=high

# Registry settings (use default npm registry)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Engine strict mode - fail if Node version doesn't match
engine-strict=true

# Prefer offline packages when available
prefer-offline=true

# Progress bar (disable in CI)
# progress=false
