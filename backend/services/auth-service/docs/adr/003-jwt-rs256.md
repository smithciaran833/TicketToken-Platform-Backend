# ADR-003: JWT with RS256 for Token Signing

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Token signing algorithm selection impacts:
- Security of token validation
- Key distribution to other services
- Key rotation complexity
- Performance of sign/verify operations

## Decision
Use RS256 (RSA with SHA-256) for JWT signing instead of HS256.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Asymmetric keys allow public key distribution
- Other services can verify tokens without private key access
- Supports JWKS endpoint for key discovery
- Industry standard for multi-service architectures
- Enables key rotation with multiple active keys

### Negative
- Larger token size than HS256
- Slower sign/verify operations (mitigated by caching)
- More complex key management (key pairs vs single secret)
- Requires secure storage for private key

### Neutral
- Standard JWT libraries support RS256
- Key rotation patterns are well-documented
