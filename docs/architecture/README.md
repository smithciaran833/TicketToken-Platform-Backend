# Architecture Documentation

## What Goes Here

- **System Overview**: High-level architecture diagram showing all 21 microservices
- **Service Communication**: How services talk to each other (REST, RabbitMQ, etc.)
- **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system (user registration → event creation → ticket purchase → NFT minting)
- **Technology Stack**: Why we chose each technology (Postgres, Redis, Solana, etc.)
- **Design Decisions**: Major architectural choices and tradeoffs
- **Service Dependencies**: Which services depend on which (dependency graph)

## Files to Create

- `system-overview.md` - The big picture

- `data-flow.md` - End-to-end data flows
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology choices and rationale
- `design-decisions.md` - ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
