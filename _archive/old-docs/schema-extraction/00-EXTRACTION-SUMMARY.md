- Every model, interface, type, and enum definition
- Every SQL query pattern
- Every table reference
- Every column reference
- All configuration files

1. Review each service's complete extraction
2. Use pattern matching to extract all table names
3. Use pattern matching to extract all column names
4. Map relationships between tables
5. Build the final schema document
